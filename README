This module contains Java source files for Joost.

The file build.xml is the Ant buildfile. Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool
and can be downloaded from http://ant.apache.org/
Required version: 1.6 or above

For compiling you need several jars in the lib subdirectory or in your
classpath respectively. The CVS contains only joostGen.jar, compiled from 
the sources in the helper module.

Additionally you have to install
- log4j from http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/
  (Latest tested version: 1.2.7)
- junit.jar from http://junit.org/ and
  xercesImpl.jar (version 2.6.0) from http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/
  for compiling the src/test package
- fop.jar and avalon-framework-cvs-20020806.jar
  from http://xml.apache.org/fop/ 
  (Latest tested version: 0.20.5)
  for compiling sf.net.joost.emitter.FOPEmitter.java
  (If you don't want a FOP connection just remove this file and
  comment out some lines in sf.net.joost.Main.java)

If you don't have Java 1.4 installed on your computer, you have to 
add manually a SAX2 compliant parser and the JAXP 1.1 interfaces, too.
