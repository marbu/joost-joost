- the binary should be Java 1.4 compatible again
- Bugfix: 1755658

Changes since 20070529
- Bugfixes: 1730697, 1741087
- incorporated code from Michael Kay's Saxon to support full XPath 2.0
  regular expressions
- added matches(), replace(), tokenize()

Changes since 20060205
- Added special element joost:script for script support (e.g. Javascript)
  (thanks again to Fikin).
- Bugfix: 1446221

Changes since 20050521
- added plugin ability for net.sf.joost.TransformerHandlerResolver classes;
  no need any more to programatically register filter implementations, Joost
  will automatically detect them after their registration as Java 1.3 services,
  i.e. in the META-INF/services/net.sf.joost.TransformerHandlerResolver file
  (thanks to Fikin).
- xslt and stx filters support transformers reusage (thanks to Fikin).
- added support for Unicode surrogate pairs
- output numbers in a XML Schema conformant way (prevent scientific notation)
  (Feature request 1337383)
- added 'append' attribute to stx:result-document
- Fix for #1215468 required a change in the TransformerHandlerResolver interface:
  added URIResolver parameter in 
  TransformerHandler resolve(String, String, String, URIResolver, Hashtable)
- Bugfixes: 1215468, 1365639

Changes since 20041107
- added command line switch -noext and TrAX attribute ALLOW_EXTENSION_FUNCTIONS
  to prevent/allow the call of Java extension functions
- changed url(...) specification for the 'filter-src' attribute:
  the part between 'url(' and ')' will be evaluated as an STXPath expression.
  This means unquoted URLs like in "url(filename.xsl)" won't work anymore,
  use "url('filename.xsl')" instead.
- relaxed buffer restrictions: allow adding non-well-formed XML within a
  single stx:result-buffer instruction; the buffer contents must be
  well-formed when stx:process-buffer is called (thanks to Maurice Jumelet)
- Bugfixes: 1086639, 1086657, 1093383, 1107878, 1170453, 1170454, 1170668

- added filter methods for STX (http://stx.sourceforge.net/2002/ns) and
  SAX parsing (http://xml.org/sax)

  stylesheet-prefix will be used, but mapped to the new namespace)

  Fixed SAXSource usage in TransformerFactory.newTransformer(...)

  since @separator defaults to " ", the default behaviour changed if 
  @select evaluates to a sequence
- implemented stx:include

  stx:process-children, and stx:process-self;

  SAX TransformerHandlers 
  (see API doc for this interface, as well as the samples.NSFilter example)

  expression to {uri-reference} (spec change 2003-06-09)
- small change in sum(): discard NaN values
- allow stx:param as child of stx:group (spec change 2003-06-20)

  a template before any other children (I don't know where I got this from)
- added (partial) support for TrAX output properties
- added support for Java extension functions
- added Joost extension function sequence(), which converts a Java array or
  a java.util.List object to a sequence;

- Bugfix: 748089

Changes since 20030320
- increased performance by switching to a new processing model
- changed stx:for-each to stx:for-each-item; removed current-item();
  position() doesn't change inside for-each-item
- removed level() and get-node()
- removed stx:options, moved its attributes to stx:transform and stx:group
- in stx:template and stx:procedure:
  changed visibility=private|public|global to local|group|global,
  added public=yes|no 
- all functions are now in the default namespace for STX functions
  http://stx.sourceforge.net/2003/functions 
  (but there's no need to change any STX transformation sheet, because
  this namespace will be used automatically)
- Bugfixes: 723018, 723024, 728919, 730112
- switched from Log4J to Commons-Logging;
  removed logging configuration from Main completely (in release versions)

- added 'encoding' attribute to stx:result-document;
  missing directories will now be created automatically
- added stx:while
- change for buffers: allow stx:process-buffer inside of stx:result-buffer
  for the same buffer; its new contents is available not before the buffer
  has been completely filled (stx:result-buffer has finished)
- change for stx:process-self: if no group is specified then the base
  group for matching is the current group, not the previous group
- removed current(), added current-item() for accessing the current item
  inside of stx:for-each; a location path accesses *always* the ancestor stack
- added node-kind()
- made level() and get-node() deprecated
- removed deprecated location path components
- Bugfixes: 697408, 699541, 702885, 703059, 705697
