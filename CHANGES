Changes since 20030908
- added string-join(), ends-with(), string-pad(), exists(), index-of(), 
  insert-before(), remove()

Changes since 20030623
- renamed attributes: 'filter' to 'filter-method', 'src' to 'filter-src'
- added 'filter-method' and 'filter-src' attributes to stx:process-document
- added filter methods for STX (http://stx.sourceforge.net/2002/ns) and
  SAX parsing (http://xml.org/sax)
- added stx:namespace-alias (in the result the original prefix, aka
  stylesheet-prefix will be used, but mapped to the new namespace)
- added min(), max(), avg()
- added URIResolver support for stx:process-document and stx:include
- Internal: added XMLReader parameter to Processor constructor;
  Fixed SAXSource usage in TransformerFactory.newTransformer(...)
- Bugfix: 765301

Changes since 20030502
- added 'separator' attribute to stx:value-of; 
  since @separator defaults to " ", the default behaviour changed if 
  @select evaluates to a sequence
- implemented stx:include
- added 'filter' and 'src' attributes to stx:process-buffer, 
  stx:process-children, and stx:process-self;
  enabled built-in passing of SAX events to a (JAXP conformant) XSLT engine
- added TransformerHandlerResolver interface for using custom
  SAX TransformerHandlers 
  (see API doc for this interface, as well as the samples.NSFilter example)
- added filter-available()
- renamed attribute 'default-stxpath-namespace' to 
  'stxpath-default-namespace' in stx:transform (spec change 2003-05-27)
- added 'exclude-result-prefixes" to stx:transform
- changed type of the 'href' attribute in stx:result-document from 
  expression to {uri-reference} (spec change 2003-06-09)
- small change in sum(): discard NaN values
- allow stx:param as child of stx:group (spec change 2003-06-20)
  and remove the requirement that template parameters have to occur first in
  a template before any other children (I don't know where I got this from)
- added (partial) support for TrAX output properties
- added support for Java extension functions
- added Joost extension function sequence(), which converts a Java array or
  a java.util.List object to a sequence; 
  extension namespace is "http://joost.sf.net/functions"
- Bugfix: 748089

Changes since 20030320
- increased performance by switching to a new processing model
- changed stx:for-each to stx:for-each-item; removed current-item();
  position() doesn't change inside for-each-item
- removed level() and get-node()
- removed stx:options, moved its attributes to stx:transform and stx:group
- in stx:template and stx:procedure:
  changed visibility=private|public|global to local|group|global,
  added public=yes|no 
- all functions are now in the default namespace for STX functions
  http://stx.sourceforge.net/2003/functions 
  (but there's no need to change any STX transformation sheet, because
  this namespace will be used automatically)
- Bugfixes: 723018, 723024, 728919, 730112
- switched from Log4J to Commons-Logging;
  removed logging configuration from Main completely (in release versions)

Changes since 20030224
- added 'encoding' attribute to stx:result-document;
  missing directories will now be created automatically
- added stx:while
- change for buffers: allow stx:process-buffer inside of stx:result-buffer
  for the same buffer; its new contents is available not before the buffer
  has been completely filled (stx:result-buffer has finished)
- change for stx:process-self: if no group is specified then the base
  group for matching is the current group, not the previous group
- removed current(), added current-item() for accessing the current item
  inside of stx:for-each; a location path accesses *always* the ancestor stack
- added node-kind()
- made level() and get-node() deprecated
- removed deprecated location path components
- Bugfixes: 697408, 699541, 702885, 703059, 705697

  location step within paths deprecated
- Bugfixes: 681576, 687163, 687489, 687628, 691652, 692087

Changes since 20030121

- added stx:process-siblings, stx:procedure, stx:call-procedure, stx:message
- made text() location step (data accessor) deprecated

Changes since 20021223
- added 'required' attribute to stx:param
- added 'base' attribute to stx:process-document, 
  changed type of 'href' to expression
- added stx:result-document
- renamed
  * stx:element-start to stx:start-element
  * stx:element-end to stx:end-element
  * stx:options' @no-match-events to @pass-through
  * stx:template's @recursion-entry-point to @new-scope
- implemented sequence data type
- sequence functions: empty(), item-at(), subsequence(), count(), sum()
- other functions: string(), number(), boolean()
- variables and parameters will be default initialized with the empty sequence
- implemented full location paths in data accessors (except ancestor)

Changes since 20021128
- added 'markup' attribute to stx:text
- removed strict-mode (stx:transform, stx:group)
- added support for named groups
- added stx:process-document
- changed: buffers (stx:process-buffer) don't create their own ancestor stack
- added support for template parameters, stx:with-param

Changes since 20021107
- added stx:choose, stx:when, stx:otherwise, stx:else
- added stx:comment, stx:processing-instruction
- stx:cdata, stx:variable, stx:assign, stx:param, stx:attribute 
  may now contain arbitrary text producing instructions (aka "text template")
- added translate()

Changes since 20021104
- added support for global parameters (stx:param)
- Bugfixes: 634388, 634440

Changes since 20021018
- implemented the 'attributes' attribute of stx:copy
- new functions: 
  prefix, starts-with, contains, substring, substring-before, substring-after
- CDATA processing: pattern cdata() and instruction stx:cdata
- buffers: stx:buffer, stx:result-buffer, stx:process-buffer
- stx:element
- made strict-mode deprecated (stx:transform, stx:group)
- Bugfix: mappings will be reported for all namespaces currently declared,
  not only for those used in element and attribute names
  (see bug 625480)

Changes since 20020828
- added stx:process-attributes, 
  implemented attribute patterns (<stx:template match="foo/@bar"> etc.)
- changed STX namespace to "http://stx.sourceforge.net/2002/ns"
- made up the TrAX implementation
